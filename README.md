# Advent of Code_2025

Here's a collection of solutions for this year's edition of AoC!
Unfortunately, this year, only 12 problems will be released, so the competition is quite short.
BUT this may solve my major issue: consistency.

Usage:

```shell
./build/src/day_XX < inputs/day_XX.txt # For AoC website inputs
./build/src/day_XX < inputs/day_XX_tests.txt # For tests
```
> For the majority of the problems, I tend to do what I do during coding interviews/leetcode-like practice: think out loud (or in notes), so don't worry if you see errors there.
